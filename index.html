          Welcome to <strong>Folklore Blooms!</strong> Our journey began with a
          simple passion for nature’s beauty and the joy it brings to people’s
          lives. Founded in 2024, our flower shop was inspired by the idea that
          every bloom holds a story, and every arrangement has the power to
          convey emotion and create memories. Our founder,
          <strong>Florence Mae Vergara</strong>
          grew up surrounded by gardens filled with vibrant colors and
          captivating scents. This deep-rooted love for flowers sparked a
          lifelong dream to share the art of floristry with our community. From
          humble beginnings, we started with just a handful of flowers and a big
          heart. Since then, we've blossomed into a thriving shop where every
          bouquet is crafted with care and attention to detail. At [Your Flower
          Shop Name], we believe that flowers are more than just petals and
          stems—they’re expressions of love, celebration, and comfort. We are
          committed to providing exceptional, personalized service and designs
          that capture the unique essence of each occasion. From weddings and
          birthdays to “just because” moments, our arrangements are thoughtfully
          curated to bring smiles and joy to every recipient. As a locally-owned
          flower shop, we take pride in supporting sustainable practices and
          partnering with local growers. Each bloom we use is carefully selected
          for its freshness, quality, and beauty, so you can enjoy long-lasting
          arrangements that brighten any space. Thank you for being a part of
          our story. Whether you're a lifelong flower lover or a new admirer,
          we’re here to help you find the perfect arrangement that speaks from
          the heart. Stop by, say hello, and let us add a little more color to
          your life!
